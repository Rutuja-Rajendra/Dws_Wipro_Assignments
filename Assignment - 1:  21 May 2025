1. What is application packaging?

Application packaging is a way of bundling required files/settings to make installing, updating and uninstalling more easier. 

Benefits: 
Easy update and delete 
Everything is there in the package like configuration files, permissions, setting files, execution files etc. 

Installer:

1. .exe: Means the file is executable, common installer format
2. .msi: Microsoft installer 
3. .appx or .msix: new version of Microsoft installer


2. Steps to install MSIX

.msix is a new version of .msi used for windows 10/11

We can easily install, manage, uninstall applications
It is safer among .exe and .msi

Steps to install: 
	
	1. Open Poweshell as Administrator
	2. Run this command :  Add-AppPackage -Path "---path of our .msix file---".
